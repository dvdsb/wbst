I am a biostatistican/data scientist. I am a senior lecturer in biostatistics and associate professor in epidemiology.                    
                  
I am affiliated to: 
-	School of Public Health and Community Medicine, Institute of Medicine, Goteborg University                            
-	Scandinavian Surgical Outcomes Research Group (SSORG), Sahlgrenska University Hospital                                                               
I do research, supervise PhD candidates and teach.                                                

My primary focus is to contribute to the increasing knowledge on how to improve clinical decision making. I mainly work with scientific questions related to the treatment of patients diagnosed with prostate cancer, colorectal cancer or performed diverticulitis.                    
The aim is to improve survival, quality of life and functional aspects of patients undergoing surgery due to cancer or diverticulitis.
